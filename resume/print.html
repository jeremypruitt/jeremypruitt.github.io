OpenStack and Contrail SDN.</li>
              <li>Re-factored the problem management process using a framework that includes Ishikawa

            <p><i>IT Sr Manager of Cloud & Automation</i></p>
            <p>Managed a team of cloud automation engineers responsible for the automation tools and processes that drive both AWS public cloud and OpenStack private cloud environments. Designed a common automation toolchain for the configuration management and deployment of Linux, FreeBSD, OpenStack, ESX, AWS, and Contrail SDN configuration management and deployment.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Designed infrastructures and applications in AWS with no planned downtime that auto-heal,
auto-scale, and are resilient to datacenter and regional outages.</li>
              <li>Developed an infrastructure development lifecycle for managing the configuration, testing,
deployment, patching, and termination of VMs in an OpenStack environment.</li>
              <li>Developed and executed a global training program to empower cloud operators and
engineers to leverage the infrastructure development lifecycle. Training was primarily
conducted as workshops as well as pairing and peer review built into the process itself.</li>
              <li>Developed tunable automation to audit and remediate the hardening of CentOS, Ubuntu,
and FreeBSD operating systems using Ansible and Goss.</li>
              <li>Developed a solution fanotify and golang to listen for and react to filesystem events in order
to capture diffs of code changes. By capturing the diffs we can recreate the state of a
development workspace with only the diff and the commit without affecting the developer.</li>
              <li>Created CI pipelines using pipeline-as-code principles with Concourse CI (initially Jenkins) and
Docker. This allowed us to manage CI pipeline configuration as YAML files in the same git
repository as the infra and/or app code.</li>
              <li>Worked with the networking team to automate both AWS and Contrail SDN configuations.</li>

            <p><i>IT Manager of Cloud & Automation</i></p>
            <p>Managed a team of cloud automation engineers responsible for the automation tools and processes that deployed and configured ESX VMs and bare-metal operating systems.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Developed an automated pipeline for creating and deploying VMs using opensource infrastructure-as-code tools and practices.</li>
              <li>Implemented a BMC CLM-based cloud automation platform. This included all aspects of a managed cloud including a self-service portal, cost accounting, and a tunable intelligent placement engine.</li>
              <li>Consolidated all opensource automation efforts into a single toolchain for all future development. This standardized the various ad-hoc automation efforts into a common set of tools and processes. The same toolchain was used in our subsequent public and private cloud efforts, as well as our network automation efforts.</li>
              <li>I had the privilege of being the first person to run the puppet configuration management tool natively on a Junos networking device. This drove interest in using puppet and other opensource configuration management tools as part of our sales and professional services efforts.</li>

            <p>Managed a global infrastructure and operations team tasked with supporting Juniper’s engineering community. Responsible for the overall architectural vision, design, delivery, and maintenance of Juniper’s engineering infrastructure.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Managed a team that resolved 16K+ support tickets a year while adhering to TTO􀍬TTR SLAs.</li>
              <li>Responsible for the maintenance of 1,500 servers across 6 datacenters in 3 countries while adhering to time-to-own and time-to-resolve SLAs.</li>
              <li>Adopted Kanban for a cross-functional operations team in order to optimize flow and move from time-based focus to a work-in-progress focus. This increased focus due to work-in-progress limits has resulted in a significant reduction in cycle time and increased efficiency.</li>
              <li>Leveraged puppet, mcollective, cucumber, splunk, and github to deliver a new operational model and supporting processes.</li>
